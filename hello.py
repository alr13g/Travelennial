This is just a tempate but from the video im watching he uses the key
as a part of the web page traversal. So im thinking when we crawl airports for
locations we see if they already exist within our database. if not we add them and make
their custom key be the first letter of each word. if we have a key conflict then
we take the second letter from the first word infront of the first words location.

We are also should store the information so that we dont backtrack but my idea is a list of lists ie

[[Airport1, Price1], [Airport2, Price2], ect]

price2 is amount of money from airport 1 to airport 2

We should also probably have them start and end at an airport. otherwise it might be too vauge for the result and our code.
Like do they want to be on the north side or south side of california?
